bullets:
  - "Polymarket prices SpaceX IPO above $1.8T at 98%, near-certain floor, effectively a risk-free leg in spread structures."
  - "24h volume of $727K is 40% of all-time; flow into an already-certain contract implies structured position-building."
  - "At 98%, residual 2% discount likely reflects contract technicality or black-swan IPO collapse risk, not valuation doubt."
  - "Resolution contingent on IPO closing mechanics; traders appear confident the deal prices well above this threshold."

Volume into a 98% contract signals that institutional participants are using this leg as collateral or hedge against higher-strike SpaceX contracts, not a standalone directional trade.
